Test on a diatomic molecule perturbation (transformation of C-H into H-H ) 
I am going to compute a partition coefficient in this way:

- relative free energy of hydration simulations
- relative free energy of solvation in cyclohexane

from there I can compute a logP

- absolute free energy of hydration 
- absolute free energy of solvation in cyclohexane


by considering absolute and relative I should detect if the Jacobian factor
disappear or somehow remains

In order to cancel an "effect" of momenta, HH and CH molecules have the same masses
